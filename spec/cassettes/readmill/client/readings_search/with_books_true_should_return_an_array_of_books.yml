        ReviewAmazon Best Books of the\u00a0Month, November 2011: It is difficult
        to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson\u2019s Steve Jobs without feeling
        melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later.
        Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name
        and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed.
        But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something
        else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs\u2019s
        focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time
        like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons,
        and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls
        no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many
        ways his greatest strength. --Chris Schluep Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with
        Walter Isaacson Q: It''s becoming well known that Jobs was able to create
        his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you
        to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How
        did you do it? Isaacson: Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original
        Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion
        Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful:
        He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible,
        so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try
        to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me
        not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible.
        It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he
        was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value
        of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.Q: How were the interviews
        with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? Isaacson:
        I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in
        his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during
        the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and
        listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially
        when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.Q: He was
        a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk
        about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? Isaacson: Everyone was eager
        to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell
        them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context
        of how inspiring he could be.Q: Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism.
        Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs''
        contradictions contribute to his success?Isaacson: Steve was filled with contradictions.
        He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material
        objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled
        with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his
        love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They
        combined artistry and technology. Q: Jobs could be notoriously difficult.
        Did you wind up liking him in the end? Isaacson: Yes, I liked him and was
        inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can
        go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and
        cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only
        half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme
        of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his
        passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and
        he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams
        he built became extremely loyal and inspired. Q: Do you believe he was a genius?
        Isaacson: He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps
        based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections
        with those around him and with his customers.Q: Did he have regrets? Isaacson:
        He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he
        said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But
        he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty
        of both his close colleagues and his family.Q: What do you think is his legacy?Isaacson:
        His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated
        movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores.
        His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one
        that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the
        company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy,
        as he said in his \"Think Different\" ad, was reminding us that the people
        who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.Photo
