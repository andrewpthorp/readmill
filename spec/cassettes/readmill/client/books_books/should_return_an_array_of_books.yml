        next best thing to having a room key to the Chelsea Hotel during each of its
        famous\u2014and infamous\u2014decades The Chelsea Hotel, since its founding
        by a visionary French architect in 1884, has been an icon of American invention:
        a cultural dynamo and haven for the counterculture, all in one astonishing
        building. Sherill Tippins, author of the acclaimed February House, delivers
        a masterful and endlessly entertaining history of the Chelsea and of the successive
        generations of artists who have cohabited and created there, among them John
        Sloan, Edgar Lee Masters, Thomas Wolfe, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, Allen
        Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe,
        Andy Warhol, Sam Shepard, Sid Vicious, and Dee Dee Ramone. Now as legendary
        as the artists it has housed and the countless creative collaborations it
        has sparked, the Chelsea has always stood as a mystery as well: Why and how
        did this hotel become the largest and longest-lived artists\u2019 community
        in the known world? Inside the Dream Palace is the intimate and definitive
        story. Today the Chelsea stands poised in limbo between two futures: Will
        this symbol of New York''s artistic invention be converted to a profit-driven
        business catering to the top one percent? Or will the Chelsea be given a rebirth
        through painstaking effort by the community that loves it? Set against these
        two competing possibilities, Inside the Dream Palace could not be more fascinating
        or timely.**","published_at":null,"language":null,"permalink":"inside-the-dream-palace","permalink_url":"https://readmill.com/books/inside-the-dream-palace","cover_url":"https://d26cmntuippvfl.cloudfront.net/?action=shrink-w&format=png&origin=https%253A%252F%252Freadmill-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fcovers%252Fece4c3a0024d255884a566f88f30c22c1b7e57d8-original.png&width=120","cover_metadata":{"original_width":576,"original_height":871},"assets":{"items":[]},"readings_count":0,"recommended_readings_count":0,"active_and_finished_readings_count":0,"average_duration":null,"featured":false,"price_segment":null}},{"book":{"id":360819,"title":"BLACK

        against your customers'' friends and family and viral videos and cute puppies.
        To win attention these days you must ask a different question: \"How can we

        clut?ter: marketing that is truly, inherently useful. If you sell something,
        you make a customer today, but if you genuinely help someone, you create a
